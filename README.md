Packages I'm maintaining on AUR
======

These are the packages I'm currently maintaining on `AUR` (Arch User Repository):

* `eaccelerator-git`: A free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic content cache. ([The git version](https://github.com/eaccelerator/eaccelerator) supports `PHP 5.4.x`)
* `nginx-tcp`: Lightweight HTTP server and IMAP/POP3 proxy server, with [`nginx_tcp_proxy_module`](https://github.com/yaoweibin/nginx_tcp_proxy_module).
* `tengine-dev`: A web server based on Nginx and has many advanced features, originated by Taobao.
